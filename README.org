An expert system for solving Maths problems.

Currently the system:
- [X] Parses simple expressions
	- [X] The +Four+ /Six/ basic Functions
	- [X] Parentheses
	- [X] Common operators
		- Logs, Trig, Exponents
- [X] Outputs in LaTeX
- [X] Performs Constant Reduction
	- [X] Identity Elements
	- [X] Zero Elements
	- [X] Calculable Values
- [X] Parses Complex Expressions (LaTeX Like Language)
	- [X] Local Bindings
	- [X] Substitutions
	- [X] Ranged Operators (Summation)
- [X] Parses implied binding scopes
	- Parentage's are often implied in summation notation
	- This is the first step in parsing Einstein Tensor Notation
- [ ] Unnests Separable bindings
- [ ] Performs Bounded Operations
- [-] Handles all algebraic numbers
	- [-] Special Constants
		- [X] The Common Ones
		- [ ] The Uncommon Ones
	- [ ] Arbitrary precision numbers
	- [ ] Rationals and Radicals
	- [ ] Power Towers
- [ ] Factor Polynomials
	- Have a special function called =Roots= that takes a polynomial and returns the algebraic roots
	- [ ] Have special cases for the Quadratic, Cubic, and Quartic formul√¶
	- [ ] Use the Rational Root Theorem to find simple cases
	- [ ] Use Newton's method to guess values and then try local algebraic numbers
		- This will look for symbolic roots near the point
		- In the worst case, this can "factor" a polynomial with a number
      that is only approximately known, which is good enough for some
      later methods to check validity.
			- The "number" can be compared with algebraic numbers as long as
        the polynomial has finite roots within the neighborhood.
- [ ] Rationalizes Denominators
	- Only when it makes things look better?
	- Will need a "score" for how pretty a result is to perform advanced simplification
	- This same part will also be used moving complex numbers to the numerator
- [-] Explores Integration Techniques
	- [X] Dynamic Binding Scopes
	- [ ] Symbolic Differentiation
	- [ ] Tree search though substations with a simplicity metric
		- [ ] U-Substitution
		- [ ] By Parts
		- [ ] Laplace
		- [ ] Half Tangent
		- [ ] Complexifying
